# openscad-reporter
A wrapper script for OpenScad allowing for the export of parameters from OpenScad to a JSON file 

*Note: an Openscad install available on the Path is required*

The reporter can be installed globally and used as a script (provides a bin), or be imported into a js module.

## to install and use globally

```
yarn global add openscad-reporter
```
or

```
npm install -global openscad-reporter
```
make sure to have the appropriate bin folder on the `$PATH`.

This adds a `runscad` command which can then be used in e.g. a project folder

```
$   
```
